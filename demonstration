#Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures
This project demonstrates the use of hand gestures to control a virtual mouse on a computer.
By leveraging computer vision techniques, it tracks hand movements and translates them into mouse actions, such as moving the cursor, clicking, and scrolling.
The system allows users to interact with their computer in a touchless and intuitive way, offering potential applications in accessibility, gaming, and user interfaces.

#Features:
Cursor Control: Move the cursor by tracking hand gestures.
Clicking: Perform left and right clicks using specific gestures.
Scrolling: Use gestures to simulate scrolling up or down.
Hands-Free Navigation: Navigate and interact with your system without using a physical mouse or touchpad.
  
#Technologies Used:
Python
OpenCV
Mediapipe (for hand tracking)
PyAutoGUI  
(Any additional libraries/tools used) 

#Setup:
Clone this repository.
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the script to start controlling the mouse with hand gestures.

#How Hand Movement Controls the System
  
Hand Detection: The system uses MediaPipe to detect and track the hand landmarks in real-time through your webcam. 
  It processes each frame and identifies key points on the hand (such as fingertips, wrist, and palm).

Cursor Movement:

The position of the index finger (landmark 8) is tracked to move the cursor.
The get_position() function translates the position of the index finger (relative to the camera) to screen coordinates (mouse position).
The movement is stabilized by dampening, so small hand movements wonâ€™t cause jerky cursor behavior.
Gestures for Actions:

Fist Gesture: Closing the hand into a fist will "grab" the mouse, allowing the user to drag the cursor. 
  The system detects this gesture and simulates a mouse down action (holding the left button).
  
Pinch Gesture: When the thumb and index fingers come closer, a scrolling action is triggered:
If the pinch movement is vertical, the system scrolls up or down.
If the pinch is horizontal, the system scrolls horizontally.
  
V Gesture: Holding up the index and middle fingers in a "V" shape triggers the mouse click.
Two Finger Closed Gesture: Bringing the thumb and index fingers together and closing them triggers a double-click.
Multi-Hand Support:

The system can track both left and right hands. Depending on your dominant hand (which can be set in the code), the right or left hand will control the mouse.
Each hand can be used for different controls (e.g., left hand for movement, right hand for clicking).
Stabilization: To ensure smooth control, the system uses a dampening technique: it reduces the sensitivity of the mouse movement when the hand is not moving significantly, avoiding erratic cursor jumps.
